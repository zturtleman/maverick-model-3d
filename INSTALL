Maverick Model 3D Installation
============================

If you are running on Windows see INSTALL.WIN32.  If you are running
on a Unix-like system, installation instructions follow.

Maverick Model 3D requires the following packages for proper operation.
They are most likely already installed if you have a modern working
Linux system.

   Qt (3.x or 4.x) with OpenGL support
      http://www.trolltech.com
   OpenGL with GLU (probably Mesa if you are using Linux)
      http://www.mesa3d.org/

For Qt 3.x support, see notes on QTDIR below.

Even if you have these packages installed you may need to install
development packages as well.  These include header files which are
needed to compile Maverick Model 3D.  Often such packages are marked
as -dev or -devel by your distribution.  For example, sometimes
Qt is broken up into a qt rpm and qt-devel rpm.  In this case, you
must have both installed.

If you are lucky you can install this program by running these commands at a
shell prompt (terminal window):

   make
   su [become root]
   make install

On some system configurations you may need to run "sudo bash" instead of
"su" to get a root shell.

The default PREFIX (install location) is /usr/local.  Files are
installed in the following directories.

   PREFIX/bin                            - mm3d executable
   PREFIX/share/maverickmodel3d/plugins  - plugins
   PREFIX/share/doc/maverickmodel3d      - program documentation

You can give make arguments to change how the program is 
compiled.  For example you can change the default install location 
by specifying PREFIX=PATH, where PATH is the new install location.

If Qt is not detected and you have it installed, try using QTDIR=PATH
to specify the directory where Qt is installed.  In a default Qt 
installation this is what your QTDIR environment variable is set to.
Include files are in $QTDIR/include and library files are in $QTDIR/lib.

Currently on Unix-like systems you must explicitly use QTDIR=PATH
to specify the location of Qt 3.x (ie, Qt 3.x will not be detected
automatically).

Sometimes development files are in separate paths completely, such as
libs in /usr/lib/qt3 and headers in /usr/include/qt3.  In this case 
use QT_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/qt3 and QT_LIB_DIR=/usr/lib/qt3.
