This is the README file for Maverick Model 3D

Maverick Model 3D is a 3D model editor.  It was written and tested on Linux.
It is reported to run on other Unix-like operating systems. It also runs
on Windows. See INSTALL.WIN32 for Windows-specific instructions.

Maverick Model 3D requires Qt (3.x or 4.x) with OpenGL support.  See the INSTALL
file for details on where to get these packages.

If you are lucky you can install this program with these easy steps:

   make
   su [become root]
   make install

Depending on your system configuration, you may have to run "sudo bash"
instead of "su" to get a root shell.  This will build an 'mm3d' executable
and install it in /usr/local/bin.  Documentation will be in
/usr/local/share/doc/maverickmodel3d.

For more detailed installation instructions, see the INSTALL file.
See INSTALL.WIN32 for Windows-specific instructions.
